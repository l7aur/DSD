INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net c2/c1/c2/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin c2/c1/c2/c1.aux[3]_i_3/O, cell c2/c1/c2/c1.aux[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT c2/c1/c2/c1.aux[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
c2/c2/c0/c1.aux_reg[0], c2/c2/c0/c1.aux_reg[1], c2/c2/c0/c1.aux_reg[2], and c2/c2/c0/c1.aux_reg[3]
